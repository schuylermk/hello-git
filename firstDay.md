# First Day of Epicodus
There was a lot of expectations going into this first day, but all in all, both my pair and I had the general feeling of slight disappointment. Perhaps it was due to our neighbors seeming to fly through all of the exercises with very few problems, and completing all of the day's tasks while we found ourselves picking apart each element we didn't understand. Perhaps, also, we just thought that the pile of exercises wouldn't have amounted to such a challenging number. Either way, we left with some of the day's work unfinished, only taking comfort in the fact that much of what we were trying to get down in this one day would be integrated into the rest of our lives as programmers, and that it will be learned and solidified through unavoidably practicing the concepts on a day to day basis.

### Our Struggles
While some concepts were simple, probably because we had each had some prior experience with them, others were quite a bit tougher. They were...
+ Grasping the idea of Git in general.
+ Following along with the [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics) git videos.
+ Smoothly using the Treehouse console.
